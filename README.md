# SpikeVision

## A Fully Spiking Neural Network Transformer-Inspired Model for Dynamic Vision Sensors

### For training SpikeVision with DVS128 gesture dataset, you need to download DvsGesture.tar.zip manually and put it under "data/DVS128/download/" folder, also with the packages listed in the requirement.txt

### You can use ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all required packages

### The training codes are under "Python/" folder, run "train_DVS.ipynb" to start training. The highest accuracy model will be saved under "results/DVS128/" folder and start with "low-precision" if quantization is applied
